## Features

- **Multi-Format Export**: Convert and export downloaded chapters to:
  - **Images**: Raw images (`.jpg`/`.png`) in structured directories.
  - **CBZ**: Comic Book ZIP archives, ready for your favorite reader.
  - **PDF**: Single, high-quality document per chapter.
- **Smart Metadata Loading**: Paste any `kagane.to` series URL, reader URL, or Series ID to load chapter lists instantly.
- **Background Downloader**: Built on Chrome Extension Manifest V3 (MV3). Downloads run asynchronously in a Service Worker, preventing loss of progress even when closing the popup.
- **Secure Bypass & DNR Routing**: Utilizes `declarativeNetRequest` (DNR) rules to handle request headers (`Referer` and `Origin`), bypassing hotlinking protections on CDN hosts (e.g., `kstatic.to`, `yuzuki.kagane.to`, `akari.kagane.to`).
- **Concurrent Processing & Queue**: Configure chapter and page concurrency to balance speed and rate-limiting safety.
- **Dynamic Progress Tracking**: Live-updated progress bars, statuses, and history logs inside the extension popup.
